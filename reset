   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mSmitten Kitchen’s Deb Perelman created a waffle recipe that’s easy (one bowl, hand-mixed), makeable without advance planning, whole grain (which offsets the inevitable puddles of syrup, right?), and crispy. “I also wanted them to have a neutral palate for the adults who prefer our breakfasts savory,” she says. “Sugar-free waffles allow us all to choose our own breakfast adventure: My husband and I top them with eggs and bacon or sautéed vegetables and cheese, while the kids smother theirs with fruit and syrup.”[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

You bake the cheesecake first, then the pound cake on top, and flip the whole thing over before decorating and serving. Room temperature eggs, cream cheese, and butter are vital to an evenly mixed cheesecake and fluffy pound cake. If you’re in a hurry, place the eggs in a bowl of hot tap water and zap the butter and cream cheese in the microwave in 10-second increments to quickly warm them up.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

Line bottom with a parchment paper round, then line sides with a 4[1;35m\"[0m[31m parchment collar (this cake will rise up the sides, so yeah, it needs to be 4[1;35m\"[0m[31m high), making sure the ends overlap by at least 3[1;35m\"[0m[31m. (Take your time to smooth out the parchment because every wrinkle will show up in the final cheesecake. Or crumple the parchment fully before lining the pan and go for an intentionally wrinkled cheesecake.) Place a wire rack in a roasting pan or scrunch up foil to make a ring for the cheesecake to rest on since you want a layer of water between the roasting pan and cake pan. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.Step 2Separate yolk from 1 egg over a small bowl to catch egg whites. Place egg yolk in another small bowl; set egg white aside for making pound cake. Beat cream cheese, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed, scraping down sides of bowl halfway through, about 3 minutes. Mix in sour cream until combined. Add remaining 3 eggs one at a time, scraping down bowl after each addition, then add egg yolk and vanilla and mix just to incorporate. Scrape batter into prepared pan; reserve bowl for making pound cake. Tap cake pan firmly against counter to eliminate any air bubbles in batter. Place into prepared roasting pan and slide onto oven rack. Pour boiling water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of cake pan.

(You might think it’s done before that time, but keep going all the way). Scrape down sides of bowl, and beat in egg, then reserved egg white, scraping down bowl after each addition, until incorporated.Step 4Five minutes before cheesecake is done baking, add sour cream and vanilla to pound cake batter and beat just to combine. Add flour and mix with a rubber spatula just to combine.Step 5Remove cheesecake from oven and gently dollop pound cake batter all over top of cheesecake with a spoon. Use spoon to delicately smooth surface, taking care not to push into cheesecake. Bake until cake is deep golden brown (it should be very dark) and bounces back when gently pressed in the center, 35–40 minutes. (This cake is very moist, so it’s better to overbake rather than underbake it.) Remove cake pan from water bath and let cheesecake cool 30 minutes (just so it’s not piping hot). Transfer to the fridge and chill at least 3 hours.Step 6For the best texture, let cheesecake sit at room temperature 30 minutes before serving. Run an offset spatula or butter knife along inside of pan to loosen cake. Place a large plate upside down over cake and flip pan and plate over to turn cake out onto plate. Peel away parchment and dust top of cheesecake with powder of choice if desired. For clean slices, cut with a knife dipped in hot water, wiping blade clean between each cut. Serve with fruit if desired.Step 7Do ahead: Cheesecake can be made 5 days ahead.

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThis pick-your-own-protein salad is all about the green goddess dressing, an herby, punchy, creamy green sauce that originated in San Francisco in the 1920s. It's just as delicious as it is versatile: You can use any combo of tender herbs (cilantro, mint, basil, parsley, dill, tarragon, chives), cultured dairy (yogurt, sour cream, buttermilk, labneh, crème fraîche), and acid (lemon juice, lime juice, unseasoned rice vinegar, apple cider vinegar) you'd like, which means you're never more than a whiz away from a batch. Mix it into shredded poached and chilled chicken breasts, high-quality canned tuna, chickpeas, or boiled-and-chopped eggs. [1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31m1.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt heavily.2.Meanwhile, place a clean kitchen towel in a large bowl (or on a large cutting board). Trim 2 lb. zucchini or summer squash (4–6), then grate on the large holes of a box grater directly into towel. Peel 1 large shallot and grate on the large holes of grater into towel. Peel 4 large garlic cloves and grate on the small holes of grater into towel.3.Gather ends of towel together, then squeeze over bowl (or the sink) with all your might to extract water from the zucchini. Squeeze until it’s hard to get out any more liquid. You should have extracted about ⅔ cup zucchini liquid, just FYI; discard.4.Heat 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or very large skillet over medium-high. Add ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add zucchini mixture (unwrap the balled-up towel over the pot for easiest transfer) and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and stir to coat. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until zucchini mixture is jammy, thick, and starting to stick to bottom of pot, 15–20 minutes.5.When the zucchini has been cooking 5–10 minutes, add 12 oz. spaghetti, linguine, bucatini, or other long pasta to pot of boiling water and cook until al dente. Scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking liquid and set aside.6.Meanwhile, juice 1 lemon into a small bowl. Grate ½ oz. Parmesan on the small holes of grater (you should have about ¼ cup; you can also use ¼ cup pre-grated Parmesan). Very coarsely tear or chop ½ cup (lightly packed) basil or mint leaves.7.Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with zucchini—it’s okay if some water clings to it. Reduce heat to medium-low, add ½ cup pasta cooking liquid and ½ cup heavy cream, and stir to combine. Add cheese, pour another ½ cup pasta cooking liquid over top, and cook, stirring vigorously with tongs or a wooden spoon and add more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until a creamy sauce that coats pasta forms, 2–3 minutes.8.Remove pasta from heat and stir in 2 Tbsp. lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt and black pepper and add more lemon juice (you may want to add an additional 1 Tbsp.). Stir in most of the herbs.9.Serve pasta topped with more grated Parmesan and remaining herbs.1.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt heavily.2.Meanwhile, place a clean kitchen towel in a large bowl (or on a large cutting board).

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mStep 1Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower eggs into water one at a time. Immediately set a timer for 7 minutes and cook eggs, maintaining a low boil. Carefully transfer eggs to a large bowl of ice water and let cool until just slightly warm, about 2 minutes. Gently crack eggs all over and peel, starting from the fat end containing the air pocket. Gently dry eggs with a clean dish towel.Step 2While eggs cook, purée ginger, garlic, yogurt, cardamom, cinnamon, pepper, and half of onion in a blender until smooth; set aside.Step 3Heat ghee in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until it sizzles as soon as an egg hits the skillet, about 1 minute. Fry whole eggs, rotating twice to get golden brown and crispy on 3 sides, about 5 minutes total. Using a slotted spoon, transfer eggs to a plate, leaving ghee behind; generously season eggs with salt.Step 4Add remaining onion to skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon and leaving as much fat in skillet as possible, transfer half of fried onions to plate with eggs (but keep them separate); season with salt.Step 5Add apricots to skillet with remaining fried onions and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until just starting to blister, about 1 minute.Step 6Add reserved yogurt purée and cook, stirring frequently and smashing against sides and bottom of pan (the yogurt paste will begin to stick to pan and darken—this is what you want; just keep stirring and smashing until you get there), until yogurt cooks down and purée is the color of gravy, 5–7 minutes. Add bay leaf and ½ cup water to pan and scrape up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium, add coconut milk, and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded and sauce is the consistency of gravy, about 1 minute. Squeeze in juice from one-quarter of lemon; pluck out bay leaf. Return eggs (but not the frizzled onion) to sauce and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.Step 7Meanwhile, toss radishes and mint in a medium bowl. Squeeze in juice from remaining lemon quarters; season with salt and toss again to combine.Step 8Serve egg korma with warm rice and radish salad alongside.

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mSo much to love on one plate! Skirt steak is one of our all-time favorite cuts—it's nice and thin, so all you have to do is sear it hard for a couple of minutes on each side and the interior will be a perfect medium-rare, no thermometer required. And salsa verde? Just our go-to, all-purpose condiment, ideal for waking up everything from grilled veggies to steamed fish to roasted meat. And crispy-edged, olive oil-fried eggs? Well, those need no introduction. Breakfast for dinner never looked so good.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

  steps:
   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31m1.If 1 lb. skirt steak isn’t already cut, cut it into pieces about 5[1;35m\"[0m[31m long. Pat steak dry with paper towels and place on a plate. Season generously all over with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Let rest at room temperature while you make the salsa verde. Usually you want steak to sit out at least 1 hour to cook more evenly, but with skirt steak, it’s okay to cut down on that time because it cooks so quickly.2.Pick leaves and tender stems from 1 small bunch of parsley and finely chop to make ¾ cup. Transfer to a medium bowl. While we love a parsley-based salsa verde, you can mix it up with any tender, flavorful leafy things you have on hand—cilantro, dill, watercress, and/or arugula make for a tasty sauce, too.3.Using a Microplane, finely grate 1 garlic clove and 1 tsp. lemon zest into bowl with parsley.4.Squeeze 1 lemon half into bowl (make sure no seeds get in there) to yield about 4 tsp.5.Coarsely chop 1 Tbsp. capers and add to bowl. Mix in ½ tsp. red pepper flakes, ½ tsp. sugar, and ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt. Set salsa verde aside until ready to serve. If you like a looser sauce, add a bit more oil to thin it out.6.Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high. Pat steaks dry again with paper towels. You really want it to be as dry as possible; this will help you get the nice brown crust you're after. Rub a bit of extra-virgin olive oil all over steak, just to lightly coat.7.Once pan is nice and hot, using tongs, gently lay steak in pan. Working in 2 batches, cook, undisturbed, until a golden brown crust forms, 2–3 minutes. Turn steak and cook until second side forms a golden brown crust, about 2 minutes longer. You don’t need to use a meat thermometer here because the steak is so thin; a general rule is that once it has a nice sear, it’s already perfectly cooked. If you have a very hot pan, this will happen quickly.8.Transfer steaks to a cutting board as you go. Wipe out skillet. Let steak rest 10 minutes.9.While steak rests, pour enough oil into skillet to coat bottom of pan and heat over medium. (Don't have a well-seasoned cast-iron pan? You might want to consider switching to a non-stick for this part.) Immediately crack 4 large eggs into pan. (You don’t need to wait for the oil to heat up because there’s already a lot of residual heat in the pan from when you cooked the steak.)10.Cook eggs, undisturbed, until edges are crispy, whites are set, and yolks are still runny, 4–6 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; season with salt.11.Slice steak against the grain, then transfer to a platter. Arrange eggs alongside steak.

(If using active dry yeast, mix together yeast and water. Let sit 5 minutes, then stir in both flours, salt, and oil.) Cover bowl with a dish towel and let sit 5 minutes.Step 2Using a wet hand or a bowl scraper, reach slightly under dough and lift one side up from the bottom and pull it up as far as you can without breaking it (this won’t be very far at first), then fold it over and toward the center. Rotate bowl 90° and repeat process. Repeat two more times. Cover bowl again and let sit another 5 minutes, then repeat folding process. Let sit and fold twice more (you will have folded dough a total of 4 times, with a 5 minute rest in between each). Your dough will get smoother and stretchier as you go and sit a bit rounder in the bowl. (You’re building the gluten structure here so that the dough will have lots of little air pockets when it bakes.) Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a silicone lid and chill at least 12 and up to 72 hours.

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31m“There are a lot of American expats celebrating Thanksgiving in Mexico, where I grew up,” says chef Danny Mena, author of Made in Mexico. “One year, a good friend invited me over for their big family celebration. They had made half a turkey the traditional roasted method, and the other half they made into a pozole, and the pozole was a clear winner. So every so often, I’ll make turkey pozole with Thanksgiving leftovers. Pozole is basically a pork and hominy broth that can be clear (nothing much else added), red (dried chiles), or green (fresh chiles and may have tomatillos and pumpkin seeds). Turkey broth can be a bit intense, so I like green pozole with fresh chiles, which balances it out very nicely.”[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
